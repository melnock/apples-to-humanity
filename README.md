## Set-up

Fork and clone this repository. 

run `rails db:create`, `rails db:migrate`, and `rails db:seed` to create the database of black and white cards.

`rails server` to start the server.

open your local host in the browser. 

Now Play! 

If you want to play multi-player on the same local host, using a plugin like ngrok can facilitate that.
